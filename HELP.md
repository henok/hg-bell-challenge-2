# Henok Ghebrezghi - Bell Technical Interview Question 2

This is a simple mobile application that contains a single activity. 
 
 When activity loads, you will see the following: 
 1. A welcome message text
 2. A button that says "Click Me", which begins to run the main flow. 
 3. A dialog pop-up that displays the last modify date from API call. 
 
 Technology stack used 
 - 
 1. Kotlin 
 2. RxJava 
 
 Design Approach
 - 
 The code is implemented using a "clean" architecture approach. 
 This allows for clear separation of layers in the applications.
 
 The layers in this application include: 
 1. Activity / View Layer - Responsible for rendering the view on specific events. 
 2. View Model Layer - Responsible for running view logic related code. 
 3. Use Case Layer - Responsible for running business logic/rules. 
 4. Service Layer - Responsible for acting as the bridge between our application domain and external application domain
